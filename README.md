### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard).

1. User Story: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

2. User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

3. User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

4. Hint: To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.

5. Hint: To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
